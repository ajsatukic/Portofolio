            <p>My name is Ajša, and I am currently a computer science student at the Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics in Sarajevo. I completed my high school education at the First Gymnasium in Sarajevo and later enrolled in IT Academy, where I specialized as a Java developer. Additionally, I have taken courses in HTML and CSS to expand my knowledge in web development.</p>
            <p>Throughout my education, I have always strived for excellence, which was especially evident when I won first place in the "Project Citizen" competition. This achievement motivated me to continue working and engaging in activism, leading me to volunteer in various projects. I’ve had the opportunity to volunteer at significant events, such as the Sarajevo Unlimited conference, where I gained valuable experience and expanded my network of contacts. I also volunteered at film festivals, which allowed me to meet people from different industries and gain insight into diverse professional fields.</p>
            <p>One of the most notable volunteering experiences for me was serving as the right-hand to the Swedish delegation at the European Youth Olympic Festival (EYOF) 2019 in Sarajevo. This role gave me the chance to work in a dynamic international environment and test my skills in organizing large-scale events.</p>
            <p>In addition to volunteering, I like to stay up to date with the latest technological trends and practices, which is why I’ve attended numerous conferences. Some of the most significant ones include the MSCommunity conference held in Konjic and the Women For Cyber conference in Sarajevo, where I had the opportunity to learn about current topics in technology and cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy various sports. Skiing, ice skating, swimming, volleyball, and football are activities that bring me joy and help me maintain a balance between mental and physical health. Sports also provide me with opportunities to relax and socialize with friends.</p>
            <p>I highly value continuous self-improvement, whether it’s learning new technologies, volunteering, or engaging in sports. I believe life is full of opportunities for growth, and I always strive to make the most of them.</p>
